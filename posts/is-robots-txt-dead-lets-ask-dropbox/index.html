            <div class="post-content">
                <p>First off I&rsquo;d like to give creds to Francis Brown and Rob Ragan who presented their talk <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#Brown">Tenacious Diggity</a> at <a href="https://www.defcon.org/">DEFCON 20</a> where I found out about the apparent steam-rolling of Dropbox&rsquo;s robots.txt file. For as far back as I can remember, the robots.txt file has been a ban-list of places that search engine crawlers are supposed to ignore when crawling a site. Recently however there is some talk that the preferred way of disallowing crawlers is to control them using alternative methods such as metatags and javascript.</p>
<p>It may appear however, that Google has already decided that robots.txt is merely a bug heading towards it&rsquo;s windscreen and is indexing pages that are excluded via the robots.txt as is apparent with Dropbox.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/T3Gnp.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>Above is a copy of Dropbox&rsquo;s <code>robots.txt</code> file and you can clearly see that <code>/gallery/</code> is on the no-fly list however the following screenshot suggests otherwise.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/yUrYp.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>Why should you care about this? What&rsquo;s so special about &ldquo;Gallery&rdquo; anyway? Well if you are a Dropbox user and you have ever clicked &ldquo;Start Import&rdquo; when seeing the below message, you should know that those photo&rsquo;s of yours may just be on that Google search result and as a result, public.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/aEzN3.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>I&rsquo;m almost positive that Dropbox did not want the galleries to be indexed and I&rsquo;m also sure that Googles Army of Lawyers has a good reason why it was but as a curious individual who enjoys tinkering with things I couldn&rsquo;t resist having a snoop through some of the results.</p>
<p>By appending some choice keywords to the searches such as confidential, screen, budget, excel, portfolio, audition, temp, delete and a few others, I was absolutely staggered at the amount of useful data people have images of. Just in the first 10 or so pages of each result I was able to find bank statements, drivers licenses, credit cards, passwords, wifi keys, serial numbers, medical information and yes&hellip; lots and lots of porn (<em>home made mostly</em>)</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/3fi1S.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re bored like me or digging  up some info for (<code>$insert legitimate reason here</code>) it is a fantastic search to kill time with. If you are planning on being pro-active with it, go and get Stach &amp; Liu&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.stachliu.com/resources/tools/google-hacking-diggity-project/attack-tools/">Search Diggity</a> tool and look at some of the fantastic features they&rsquo;ve built for searching for documents through Skydrive, AWS S3 and Dropbox.</p>
