      <description>Recently while conducting a vulnerability assessment for a rather large customer I was given a list of hostnames from around 20 domains culminating in a list of over 5000 targets that needed to go through the motions. Due to scale of the testing I needed to run the scans from several cloud nodes simultaneously to speed up the scanning. The other thing I needed to do was to extract all the IP addresses from the hostnames so as not to scan boxes multiple times when performing Port Scans for instance.</description>
