      <description>Every now and then I come across some application that may (or may not) have been developed with penetration testing in mind but it ends up being damn helpful all the same. Yesterday I found a post about srvdir which is designed to share content over SSL/TLS via a public site.

      <description>About a month ago, Vulnhub released a boot2root image built by Lok_Sigma called Hades. The box promised to be full of annoyances and it delivered them in droves. Requiring a combination of exploit development, reverse engineering and some out of the box thinking, I really enjoyed this challenge. I decided to share my solution now that the competition is over. It goes without saying this post has a lot of SPOILERS!</description>
