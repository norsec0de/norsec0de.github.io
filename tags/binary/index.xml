      <description>I came across a database while testing the other day which happily contained a table called users with the good old id, username and password fields. What made this a somewhat interesting find was the fact that the passwords appeared to be encrypted as base64.
After I stopped giggling I dumped the database and grabbed the first few hashes in an attempt to quickly script the decryption. The script ran fine although I ended up with a lot of garbled text and no plain text passwords.</description>
