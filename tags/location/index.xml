      <description>Often when conducting security assessments it is necessary to go beyond just identifying the vulnerability, reporting it and heading out for a beer. Sometimes, like when conducting a penetration test or when asked by a client to demonstrate business risk, it is necessary to gain command line line access to the machine to show the risks associated with having a web user being able to execute commands on their machine. Often this involves getting a shell by some means but in the case of Local File Inclusion (LFI) simply finding the Apache Log location folder can be enough to start running commands on the system as the Apache service account.</description>
