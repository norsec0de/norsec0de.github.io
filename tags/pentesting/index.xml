      <description>Often while conducting an internal pentest you may gain access to a user machine through some vulnerability or more commonly via social engineering. Let’s say that you pop a shell, unprivileged, and incognito only finds unprivileged domain tokens. You could move onto another target or you can try some post exploitation reconnaissance. A commonly overlooked source of sensitive information is documents that are stored on the company servers as well as staff who think they know enough to start sharing folders with their peers and end up sharing the root of ‘C’.</description>

      <description>Often when conducting security assessments it is necessary to go beyond just identifying the vulnerability, reporting it and heading out for a beer. Sometimes, like when conducting a penetration test or when asked by a client to demonstrate business risk, it is necessary to gain command line line access to the machine to show the risks associated with having a web user being able to execute commands on their machine. Often this involves getting a shell by some means but in the case of Local File Inclusion (LFI) simply finding the Apache Log location folder can be enough to start running commands on the system as the Apache service account.</description>
