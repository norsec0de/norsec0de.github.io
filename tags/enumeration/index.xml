      <description>Recently I was running a web application assessment for a client whose system was running IIS 6.0 on Windows 2003 server. Much foosball and coffee had already gone into this assessment yet I still didn&amp;rsquo;t have the &amp;ldquo;Oh Shit, how did you find that?&amp;rdquo; discovery that makes developers curl up in a ball and rock themselves to sleep. These developers where smarter than most and this was not their first assessment either.</description>
