      <description>Lets be clear, Iâ€™m all about the offensive side of information security. I&amp;rsquo;m a pentester and I enjoy popping, rooting, owning and pwning all the things. I am aware that what we do is there to assist and encourage better defensive countermeasures but I just leave that to the experts. My colleague sitting nearby has the more unfortunate &amp;ldquo;defensive&amp;rdquo; job consisting of writing detections for all the evil things I do.</description>

      <description>Recently I was running a web application assessment for a client whose system was running IIS 6.0 on Windows 2003 server. Much foosball and coffee had already gone into this assessment yet I still didn&amp;rsquo;t have the &amp;ldquo;Oh Shit, how did you find that?&amp;rdquo; discovery that makes developers curl up in a ball and rock themselves to sleep. These developers where smarter than most and this was not their first assessment either.</description>
